There are 5 kind of message types :
* (C) convention, for programming standard violation
* (R) refactor, for bad code smell
* (W) warning, for python specific problems
* (E) error, for much probably bugs in the code
* (F) fatal, if an error occurred which prevented pylint from doing further processing.
